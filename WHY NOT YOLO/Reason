The comparison between Object Detection and Density Detection methods highlights the practical advantages of using density-based analysis in the proposed Intelligent Traffic Light Control System. Object detection algorithms such as YOLO or SSD, although highly accurate (around 92%), require significantly more computational resources and processing time. Each video frame takes approximately 420 milliseconds to analyze since the algorithm identifies and classifies every individual vehicle. This leads to high CPU usage (95%), greater memory consumption (1.2 GB), and higher power requirements (~8 W), which make it unsuitable for continuous real-time operation on low-power devices like the Raspberry Pi. In contrast, the density detection technique focuses on estimating how much of the camera frame is occupied by moving vehicles rather than identifying each one. This approach drastically reduces the processing time to 85 milliseconds per frame and the CPU load to around 40%, allowing it to run smoothly and efficiently on embedded systems.
Although density detection offers slightly lower detection accuracy (88%) compared to object detection, it compensates with much higher real-time responsiveness, achieving 12 frames per second (FPS) compared to just 2 FPS with object detection. It also consumes less power (~4 W) and requires only 400 MB of memory, ensuring stable and energy-efficient performance. Moreover, its bandwidth requirement (5 MB/s) is significantly lower than that of object detection systems (30 MB/s), making it ideal for low-speed or unstable local networks where internet connectivity may be limited. Overall, while object detection is more precise, the density detection method provides a more balanced, practical, and cost-effective solution for real-time adaptive traffic control, combining acceptable accuracy with faster response time and lower hardware dependency. This efficiency makes it particularly suitable for the proposed Raspberry Pi and ESP-based implementation, where lightweight and reliable operation is critical.
