The Raspberry pi after processing calculates the Green, Red and Yellow signal time based on the Density.
then the command goes to the master ESP and the Green light is ON.
Here MAster means the one employed on the Density based signal and Slave means the one employed on the static timer based signal.
the reason to do this is not all Roads are heavily congested, some can still operate easily on the static time signal also.
therefore, when the static timer green signal is about to end , the slave gives a on command to the master 10 sec before the static timer ends.
this we have given a name as  "PIPELINED CAMERA ACTIVATION".

and within this 10 sec Rpi can process the live feed at 2FPS instead of 30FPS rate which reduces the Processing load on the RPI local server

also we are using local server instead of cloud to reduce the data transfer time.
